Here's a speechless joke:  

Imagine two smartphones sitting on a bench. One holds up a Snapchat ghost, the other a YouTube play button. Suddenly, a TikTok clock emoji *spins around* dramatically like a cowboy and slaps a "cancel" sticker on both of them.  

No words. Just pure digital chaos.

Itâ€™s ironic, isnâ€™t it? Kids today are digital natives, yet many are so engrossed with smartphones and tablets that the humble PC feels like ancient technology to them. They might struggle with simple tasks like managing files or using a keyboard shortcut, while they can navigate TikTok algorithms like pros. It's a funny twistâ€”tech evolution creating a gap in the very generation you'd expect to master all forms of tech. 

What's next? Teaching kids how to double-click might become a part of history class! ðŸ˜„
